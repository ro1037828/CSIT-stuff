 <h2>Lab 2</h2>
 <p> I had some trouble making sure I had the correct tags and spacing, 
  if something wasn"t spaced right an error would come up when I went to validate the webpage I got like 16 errors and used that 
as a guide to what I needed to fix after fixing those errors I ran it again just to be safe. I used the HTML basic notes and W3school to help me remember which tags to use.
